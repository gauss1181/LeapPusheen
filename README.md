Welcome to Leap Pusheen, a 2-dimensional side-scroller game on the Leap Motion starring everyone's favorite adorable creature, Pusheen the Cat!

One day, Pusheen the Cat was enjoying his typically relaxing day in his house, playing with his favorite balls of yarn, when all of a sudden, an invasion strikes! He couldn't believe his eyes.

Many doge. Such evil. Very greedy. So intrusive. Much yarn. Such gone. Wow. Not amaze. The doge dogs have invaded his territory and gone off with his favorite balls of yarn! Now it's up for Pusheen to pursue such doge and grab his precious yarn back!

The game goes on indefinitely, and you start with 90 health. Whenever you get hit by a doge, you lose some health. Use the power of Leap Motion hand gestures, including waves, pinching, and fist clenching, to grab Pusheen's precious yarn back while protecting himself from the evils of such doge! The more yarn you get back, the higher your score! And the green yarn is worth more points than the purple yarn, so don't miss out on opportunities to snag the green balls!
